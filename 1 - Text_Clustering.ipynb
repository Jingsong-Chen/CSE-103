      " items minimum order charge not applied when line is splitted report request ajn converted to request hi ticket ajn has been raised by aude glandus around charges not being applied due to split order the ticket has been closed bymarcel schwark because the system was working as designed which is fine the purpose of this new request is to understand the potential impact of this design request could you send me a file reflecting for europe the orders where we did not charge a moc due to the fact that we had a split order assuming customer is not flagged nomoc you will find below the information provided by marcel in the initial ticket inc njm thank you for your support ljg hi aude i discussed the ticket with david poinsot and did some additional tests on the issue the reason why the nomoc charges was not applied is because the order line was split in njm lines at the time the sales order was created if a sales order is created with order fulfillment rule njm and only partial quantity is available the order quantity will be split in njm lines one line is created for the available quantity with today dispatch date and a second line is created for the remaining quantity with a future delivery date in the charge retrieval program it is specifically checked if a line has been split for that purpose and if this is the case the check against order amount weight and volume is not performed which means the charges based on amounts are not applied in case a order line has be split into njm lines because of partial availability the way the logic is implemented it does not make a difference if the charge is a header or line charge i did a few tests in ch company using the same item and customer as in your order if order quantity is njm and only njm pcs is available the order qty was split into njm lines no charges was applied if order quantity is njm and quantity is fully available the order line was not split and charge was applied so it is clearly the logic checking for split order lines that is causing the header charge is not applied the logic to exclude split order lines logic from the amount limit check is part of the original development and was specifically foreseen that way there is even a comment in code describing this for lines created due to split do not check quantity limits total original quantity for both lines may be greater than lower limit due to this amount limit is not checked either so this is not a bug and if the logic needs to be changed a change request is required please discuss with david if he can create a change request he is in copy of the ticket i will close the ticket as the system is apparently working as designed \n",

      "freight surcharge update we just received additional discounts from some of our freight carriers therefore we would like to update the freight surcharge rates for each of the freight carriers the current freight surcharge process within gpm allows us to select a freight carrier and a country and enter a new overriding surcharge rate the issue we are running into has to do with selecting a country we want to apply njm surcharge rate for each freight carrier across all countries however there is not an option to select all countries and are therefore forced to pick a specific country we would have to select each individual country and carrier combination to apply the new surcharge rate for a specific carrier on top of this we need to add njm customer exclusions bayer lilly j&j to each of these country carrier combinations right now we are looking at njm carriers priority solutions pdp marken and quickstat i've gone through each freight carrier's pricing tables and counted the countries affected using the current process available within gpm it took me njm minutes to add njm carrier country combination along with the njm excluded customers using the njm minute to enter the data into gpm i've calculated it'll take njm hours to enter all of the data carrier of changes njm min each tot hrs per site x njm sites allentown & mt prospect priority solutions njm min njm hrs njm hrs pdp njm min njm hrs njm hrs marken njm min njm hrs njm hrs quickstat njm min njm hrs njm hrs njm total changes njm total hours the simple solutions would be to have the 'all countries' option available in the country drop down menu which would only take njm hour to input all the data however due to the time to implement such a change we are looking at another option of executing a data change to the tables effected we would be adding njm records to the frieghtsurcharge table and njm countries x njm customer exclusions records to the frieghtsrchexcl table data to be appended to the tables will be provided by not implementing the new freight surcharges we are estimating about njm k per month of lost revenue we would be billing the customer at the lower freight surcharge rates instead of the new increased rates in the meantime we'll also need to submit a gpm enhancement request to get the 'wild card all countries' option added to the drop down so that we don't can eliminate the data changes requests going forward \n",
